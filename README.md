# André Tavares Portfolio (ATAVARES)

This project was created as I was following the amazing step-bysstep tutorial provided by EGATOR available on YouTube[https://youtu.be/G-Cr00UYokU] (https://youtu.be/G-Cr00UYokU).
Thanks EGATOR for the easy to follow tutorial.

## Some improvements

Hope you don´t mind I´ve added a few improvements my selfas I am trying to learn some React concepts.
I will keep it available in my personal site as my personal portfolio. Over time, as i deepen my studies, I will try to improve it...
